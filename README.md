n the past, most of the librarian record data of the person who borrowed a particular book manually. It was tough to trace each book as the
manual system contained redundant data in the file-based system. This system will ensure both
students and librarians can trace the library's books availability. It will allow librarians and
students to search for books by searching the book ID.
If the task was carried out manually, some mistakes will occur. These can be prevented by allowing the system to track the important information such as book
titles, authors and bookID. The system will systematically organize all the books in the library by
sorting them into different categories so that librarians and students can search them easily. Thus, this system
is created to allow the library management system's smoothness by minimizing errors.
